- `feat` - A new feature.
- `fix` - A bug fix.
- `docs` - Documentation only changes.
- `style` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).

- `perf` - A code change that improves performance.
- `test` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.

#### Scope

The scope is a single word that describes the scope of the change. This is usually the name of the file or directory that was changed.

#### Subject

The subject is a short description of the change. Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". Don't capitalize the first letter, and no dot (.) at the end.
